# Heatmap Creator Over Map Layers

This repository provides a simple tool for generating **heatmaps** over custom **map layers**. It can be used to visualize data such as population density, traffic intensity, or any other geospatial data in the form of a heatmap.

## Features

- **Custom Map Layers**: Add your own map layers (e.g., OpenStreetMap, satellite imagery) as the base.
- **Heatmap Overlay**: Easily overlay heatmaps on the selected map layer with customizable color scales and intensities.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Pan, zoom, and interact with the map and heatmap for more detailed analysis.
